# nosql-challenge

>[!NOTE]
> - In the [Setup file](/NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb), inserting the new restaurant *Penang Flavours* was done incorrectly.
>    - This issue was corrected in the [Analysis file](/NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb) under **Question 3**.

## Code Sources:
- XPert Learning Assistance was used to review and correct code as needed for both Setup & Analysis files.

- [MongoDB Query Selectors](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/#query-selectors) & [MongoDB Query for Locations](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/indexes/index-types/geospatial/2d/query/proximity-flat-surface/#std-label-2d-index-proximity-query) were both used as references to help me build the `query` portion that utilized `degree_search`, `latitude`, & `longitude` variables for **Question 3** in the [Analysis file](/NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb).

- Module 12 was used as reference for this assignment.
